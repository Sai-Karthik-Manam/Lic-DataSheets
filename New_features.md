## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Install New Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs `werkzeug` for password hashing.

### Step 2: Update .env File

Add the SECRET_KEY to your `.env`:

```bash
# Generate a secret key
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

# Add to .env
SECRET_KEY=your_generated_secret_key_here
```

Your complete `.env` should look like:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token_here
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your_folder_id_here
FLASK_DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your_generated_secret_key_here
```

### Step 3: Run Database Migration

The new features require updated database schema:

```bash
python migrate_database.py
```

This adds:
- Users table
- Activity logs table
- Additional columns in existing tables

### Step 4: Start the App

```bash
python app.py
```

### Step 5: First Login

1. Go to `http://localhost:5000`
2. You'll be redirected to login page
3. Use default credentials:
   - **Username:** `admin`
   - **Password:** `admin123`
4. ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Change the password immediately!
